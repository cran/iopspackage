Description: A developmental R tool related to the input-output product space (IO-PS).
    The package requires two compulsory user inputs (raw CEPPI BACI trade data, and any acceptable ISO country code) and has 4 optional user inputs (a value chain map, chosen complexity method, number of iterations to be performed, and a trade digit level).
    Various metrics are calculated, such as Economic- and Product complexity, distance, opportunity gain, and inequality metrics, to facilitate better decision making regarding industrial policy making.
